## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I wrote my short self-introduction:
I have been working as a full-time data scientist for a few years, but I also worked on a couple of projects as a data engineer. To make my ideas into products are the most amazing thing. 

### Chat-GPT wrote the self-introduction for me:
As a full-time data scientist, I have gained several years of experience in the field. Additionally, I have worked on a couple of data engineering projects, which have allowed me to turn my ideas into products. This process of transforming my ideas into working products has been a particularly rewarding aspect of my work.
